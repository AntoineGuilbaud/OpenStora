				<div class="content">Greetings,<br />I have had quite the ordeal trying to get my RAID restored since Seagate has no understanding of the word &quot;warranty....&quot;<br /><br />I was using the GoFlex 16TB model and all was well, until one night something happened and it would not boot up the next day and had an auto assigned IP address from DHCP (was static)<br />-As soon as it booted, it wanted to initialize the drives and destroy the R5 volume. <br />-I stopped rebooted, and tried everything without contacting Seagate since I knew they would be worthless to help.<br />-They recommended I format 1 drive and put it in slot 0 and I would be Ok to restore Raid5 once it booted back up (That was a lie!)<br />-Instead of being a moron, I took all 4 drives out and ran extended SMART tests on them and all 4 drives had partitions and passed every SMART test with flying colors. (700 hours on each one)<br />-Oh course I told Seagate, but with it taking them a week to respond with no helpful information I got annoyed<br />-I got the ST4000DM000 drive (which it contains 4 of), from Bestbuy instead of blanking one of mine and put it in the  unit and rebooted using the EXACT process outlined on the Wiki except at this point I was following Seagate's instructions<br />-I got the unit back up but the RAID never showed up. I told Seagate about this and again they offered if I pay them 3,000 to 50,000 grand to restore, they will restore the raid for me. FUCK THEM. All 4 drives are functional now, including the fully functional one I removed. (3 members with no OS, 1 with the OS, and 1 with the original non-booting OS)<br /><br />Basically the RAID is fine, just their software doesn't have a way to import and RAID from a previous restore. The drives are still unformatted as far as it knows, just the first member is formatted.<br /><br />So here is the question. Since Seagate gives 0 fucks about me, can I root my Stora appliance and try and hack the RAID back somehow? I don't know what kind of Software RAID they use, but I do know they use the RAID members for the OS, and the OS is all that randomly failed. The partition is perfectly fine and contains data.<br /><br />I just need to know how to add it as a Volume so I can import the Volume/Raid.</div>
