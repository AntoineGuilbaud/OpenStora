				<div class="content">Hello, <br />I am new.<br />I followed the wiki for easy root access and changed some of the conf files to give me transmission and started to mess with sshd_config file. I reset the goflex home and now i can't access it via ssh anymore. Port 22 seems to be close:<br />PORT      STATE    SERVICE<br />21/tcp    open     ftp<br />80/tcp    open     http<br />139/tcp   open     netbios-ssn<br />443/tcp   open     https<br />445/tcp   open     microsoft-ds<br />515/tcp   filtered printer<br />548/tcp   open     afp<br />631/tcp   open     ipp<br />6689/tcp  open     unknown<br />8200/tcp  open     unknown<br />9091/tcp  open     unknown<br />49152/tcp open     unknown<br /><br />I've tried doing a hard reset but that doesn't seem to work either.<br />Any suggestions would be great.<br />Regards,<br />Aust<br /><br />Update: Tried doing the wiki's recovery <a href="http://www.openstora.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stora_Recovery" class="postlink">http://www.openstora.com/wiki/index.php?title=Stora_Recovery</a> but can't seem to get it to recover to the stock firmware. SSH still can't be accessed. I released the reset button as soon as the light turned solid green and tried it again when the light flashed orange. Not sure if it is actually recovering or I'm doing it wrong. Had a stop watch each time. Any suggestions?</div>

I wonder if we could get a diagram? I would like to build one. I'm looking to create a replacement OS and need the cable. <br /><br />Also, are you able to share any of the dev tools that Hipserv has given to you?<br /><br />Thanks</div>
