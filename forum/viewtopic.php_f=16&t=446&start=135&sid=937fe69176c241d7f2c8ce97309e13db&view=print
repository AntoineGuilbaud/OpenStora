				<div class="content">Hi all!<br /><br />I find some problem with transmission. Often they say's &quot;file completed&quot;, but then I ask to recheck it, about 3-10% of broken pieces appear. After reload broken parts, I ask to recheck again, and broken pieces find also. Usually I need to make manual recheck up to 3-5 times. Only after this, I can be sure, that my file undamaged.<br /><br />Any suggests?</div>

				<div class="content">i installed transmission on my gfh following this easy method: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kjohna.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/bash-script-to-install-transmission-client-on-seagate-goflex-home-nas/">http://kjohna.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/ ... -home-nas/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />but i also had contacted support here to have my torrent client activated around the same time. <br /><br />i like how the first method is set up, i can just copy a torrent file to the torrent folder (via FTP or whatever) and it magically starts downloading without having to do anything through the web interface.<br /><br />this still works, but whenever i restart the server it seems to overwrite that version, as the folder method doesn't work.<br /><br />all i have to do is run the bash script again and it is solved, but i wanted to know if there was a way to make it permanent?</div>
