Super annoying!</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yeah, it's a bug.  We'll have it fixed for 2.5.1 .  What happen is you have 2 locales in your branding.conf.  So 1, fix your locale (remove one and keep the correct one).  Secondly, find the branding.conf.xx for your branding and copy the dirTorrentDownloads= in your branding.conf.  Third, create a symlink in /var/axentra/ like this:<br /><br />lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   root    31 Jan 21 20:10 torrentDir -&gt; /home/0common/Torrent Downloads .  It's ok that /home/0common/Torrent Downloads doesn't exist, it will get created when you enable torrents.<br /><br />Then Enable torrent.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Roby!</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Hi Roby,<br /><br />It appears that when I open the branding.conf I see this line :<br />locales=en_US fr_FR es_ES nl_NL de_DE it_IT sv_SE da_DK nb_NO pt_PT pt_BR zh_CN zh_TW ru_RU ko_KR ja_JP<br />and this line:<br />currentLocale=en-US<br /><br />When I open branding.conf.en-US I see a bunch of dir&quot;...&quot; including dirTorrentDownloads=Torrent Downloads<br /><br />So which one should I delete?<br /><br />Also, I am having trouble using that lrwxrwxrwx, as terminal does not recognize that command. However, in the branding.conf file it looks like my torrent directory is already set:<br />dirTorrentDownloads=Torrent Downloads<br /><br />This makes sense to me because I had transmission going before the firmware update and set to download to that directory. One thing that I should mention that might be playing a part in my problems is that there is a pesky file in the Torrent Downloads folder that cannot be deleted at all. It was part of a torrent I was running but for some reason did not finish and now it thinks it is in use and can't be deleted.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />cheers,<br />Dan</div></blockquote><br /><br />ok, by the sounds of your config files, you're not affected by the bug I mentioned (few are).  What are your permissions on the /home/0common/Torrent Downloads directory?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Roby!</div>

				<div class="content">Just found out how to change the Torrent Download directory to a custom one.<br />I don't want to have the Torrent Downloads in the GoFlex Home Public dir. But I just managed to move it to the the GoFlex Home Personal/Torrent Download dir for a certain user that I created.<br /><br />To do it. <br />Simply remove the symbolic link /var/axentra/torrentDir and create a new link to the directory of your choice. <br />Just make sure to set ownership apache:users for the directory.<br /><br /><br />@Dan, this is probably not the problem but just in case. Did you login with an admin account over ssh before using sudo -E -s. It seems that only users with admin rights can become root using the sudo -E -s. And you need to be root to remove a directory using rm -r<br /><br />/Johan</div>

Secondly there are some outstanding bugs, but we're not pushing an update to the goflex because it doesn't officially support torrents.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Roby!</div>

				<div class="content">Hello!<br />I have few questions:<br />1) I've enabled Transmission (though first time I've got &quot;unspecified error&quot; while applying its settings via GoFlex interface), but then Torrents icon became missing from GoFlex main menu! Is it normal ? It's not critical, Transmission still work on its address.<br /><br />2) settings.json insn't saved after rebooting<br /><br />3) can't access to 9091 port from internet-computer (9091 is forwarded in router), but it seems transmission prevents from accessing from non-local IPs. Tried to set &quot;whitelist&quot; to 192.168.0.*, restarted Transmission - doesn't help .</div>
