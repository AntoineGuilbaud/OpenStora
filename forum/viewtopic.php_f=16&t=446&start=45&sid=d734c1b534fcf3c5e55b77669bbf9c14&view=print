				<div class="content">So after all that is there a resolution for the unspecified error?<br /><br />My GF shipped with 2.5.1 and I get the error when I try to enable Torrents in the web interface.  I have checked the branding.conf etc. and ensured the symlink is there.  Can I (and how) start Transmission from the console?<br /><br />Will 2.5.2 fix this (yes, I know transmission is not 'supported' on the GF but I'd question what the point of including it is in that case?), and when is it due to be released.<br /><br />Torrents are a must for my setup, am I better of heading down the plugbox route?</div>

So very similar to your suggestion.   I'm very much a beginner at Linux so I'll do some research on the different effect of the two methods.<br /><br />Will also further explore your script suggestion.  I'm expecting to run the GF 24x7 so it's not critical to have an automatic restart.</div>

				<div class="content">Guys,<br /><br />i am something lost in here.<br /><br />I have installed package manager, also upgraded transmission through it to version 2.31 (arm ?), but now i cant make it look for config file in /etc/transmission/setting.json.<br /><br />[08:36:11.675] JSON parser failed in /etc/transmission//settings.json at line 11, column 5: &quot;&quot;bind-address-ip&quot;<br /><br />this is what i get and don't know what to do else.<br /><br />Although i am able to see the settings through -d dump, but i don't understand where is the new settings.json.<br /><br />Trying to disable rpc-whitelist, but it just worked for one IP, and not for other computers in my home network. <br /><br />1.92 Transmission was working fine (but my tracker is not recommending it).<br />Now at this moment i am tired trying, decided to re-flash the, but i don't get the white light  when i keep the reset button pushed (only yellow light blinking for couple of minutes).<br /><br />Is there another way to update the included 1.92 if i get to reflash the Goflex.<br /><br />Whats wrong with all this stuff...<br /><br />Please help !

				<div class="content">I think that keeping the configuration at /etc is not a good idea since it is on the GFH internal memory and it will be written frequently. I put the configuration files in a subfolder of the download directory (/var/axentra/torrentDir/.transmission/). I changed line 22 of /etc/rc.d/init.d/transimission.init file to launch the version 2.31 of transmission with the -g option to set the config directory to the current config dir:<br />        runuser -s /bin/bash 0transmission -c &quot;/opt/bin/transmission-daemon -g /var/axentra/torrentDir/.transmission/ --no-portmap&quot;<br /><br />Everything is going quite well except that the GFH is not responding for a few minutes when I add a file to download. Probably following the wiki <a href="http://www.openstora.com/wiki/index.php?title=Make_your_Stora_responsive_even_while_its_downloading" class="postlink">http://www.openstora.com/wiki/index.php?title=Make_your_Stora_responsive_even_while_its_downloading</a> will solve the problem.</div>

				<div class="content">I have enabled all the possible features in my GoFlex 2TB by editing /etc/features.conf. I have also disabled access patrol and enabled transmission. I have following issues:<br /><br />1. Transmission loads torrent butthe torrent never starts. It always stays at 0% but the status shows downloading. I have tried various torrents and verified they are healthy and was able to download from PC.<br />2. Check for updates is not able to check after clicking the button in preferences screen throws message unable to check updates.<br />3. When sending invite for share it gives error &quot;Error sending email&quot;.<br /><br />Also I have a query: Can I create a user who does not have access on the Public directory and is limoited to his private hom folders only?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />EDIT: I had to renable access patrol. The down side is all pro features are gone including Transmission option in preferences but Transmission is still availble on the GUI on port 9091. SO I am happy I can use transmission but lost flickr and fcebook sharing .. in any case I would be sharing using the native email share from now on which is also working now.</div>
