				<div class="content">I just found out (after having already installed a custom transmission daemon) that this GoFlex already has transmission.<br /><br />If you edit /etc/features.conf (and enable everything that's not there) including <br /><br />&quot;supportsTransmission&quot; = 1<br /><br />This will add a nice torrent icon to the Web interface and you can use Transmission client.<br />Now I just need to figure out how to get everything else working.

Is there something that I need to do in order for it to save?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi and Welcome Dan,<br /><br />So if i understand correctly you opened features.conf with vi from there it should not be to hard. <br /><br />Move your cursor to the bottom of the file.<br />Press the &lt;i&gt; button which makes it possible to insert characters (bottom line of your screen will read -- INSERT --)<br />Now you can add a line with supportTransmission=1 when you are done editing hit &lt;esc&gt;.<br />if you now type :wq you will save and exit the file if something went wrong and you dont want to save you can use :q!<br /><br />Good luck<br />Frank</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply Frank!<br /><br />I tried to do exactly as you said but for some reason the changes weren't sticking.

I enabled facebook but what is that &quot;premium&quot; that the OP was talking about?<br /><br />cheers,<br />Dan<br /><br />edit: I enabled the havemobile, and it looks like I can access my goflex from my ipad or blackberry!! Doesn't look like I can really do anything with the access tho, as when I try to click on any file it just boots me back to the main page where all I can see is the shares and Seagate share.<br /><br />Has any one figured out how to access the torrent interface from a mobile or while on a different network?<br /><br />Also, does anybody know how to change the upload speed of the transmission client? Ideally I would like to cap the speed so it doesn't bog down my network.<br /><br />cheers,<br />Dan</div>

(Or whatever you set it to) it skips the stupid Seagate page and their checks and just takes you direct to the torrent page. You can do this with mobile too. You might have to append &quot;?local=yes&quot; to the end of the address if you havn't done the mod on the wiki, but it does work. I often add torrents to it while I'm in work so theyre ready for the time I get home and ready to play with a new linux distro <img src="./images/smilies/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hmmmm so from my local network I can put 192.168.0.101:9091 and i get directly to the transmission (after putting in the login and pass), but I can't figure out how to do it while not on my local network, say from work on on my mobile. <br /><br />You mentioned that I have to add &quot;?local=yes&quot; to the end of the address if I haven't done the mod.

I thought that one was clear. As for setting it up, click the Cog at the bottom and set the values you want in preferences.<br /><br />As far as &quot;local&quot; goes, I should have mentioned that I use a Dynamic DNS to connect to mine and not the seagate one (i disabled all their accessing and redirection at the loss of their dynamic dns service) so I can add local=yes to the end and it works fine. I don't know how you could solve it, but I do know that as long as you go via the seagate method/website you can't get access to your torrents remotely, they have disabled it.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />first of all, thanks for the guidelines on the wiki and forum.<br />I've been able to activate most premium settings (facebook, flickr,...) and also activated the torrent client.<br />So now there is a torrent icon visible on the homepage of my GoFlex, however, it is grey and when I click it it says &quot;you must enable this feature in the preferences...&quot;<br />In the preferences I go to the torrents tab, enable torrents service, and enter a login and password (long enough and different from goflex password). Then it is 'updating preferences' and gives me an 'unspecified error'<br />So I can't seem to activate the torrent client properly.<br />any advice???</div>
