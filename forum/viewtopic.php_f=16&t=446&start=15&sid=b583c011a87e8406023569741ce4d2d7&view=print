You should be able to set up things in the transmission configuration in the etc folder, as for the login details I'm not sure. Its unlikely they're in the configuration file but I will double check in a bit.

So 1, fix your locale (remove one and keep the correct one).  Secondly, find the branding.conf.xx for your branding and copy the dirTorrentDownloads= in your branding.conf.  Third, create a symlink in /var/axentra/ like this:<br /><br />lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   root    31 Jan 21 20:10 torrentDir -&gt; /home/0common/Torrent Downloads .  It's ok that /home/0common/Torrent Downloads doesn't exist, it will get created when you enable torrents.<br /><br />Then Enable torrent.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Roby!</div>

And yes, I know your Dashboard wouldn't find it... but you have to talk to memeo for that, it's not a Axentra product.  Our installer works fine... see the mac posts <img src="./images/smilies/smiley.gif" alt=":)" title="Smiley" /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Roby!</div>

However, in the branding.conf file it looks like my torrent directory is already set:<br />dirTorrentDownloads=Torrent Downloads<br /><br />This makes sense to me because I had transmission going before the firmware update and set to download to that directory. One thing that I should mention that might be playing a part in my problems is that there is a pesky file in the Torrent Downloads folder that cannot be deleted at all. It was part of a torrent I was running but for some reason did not finish and now it thinks it is in use and can't be deleted.<br /><br />Thanks for your help!<br /><br />cheers,<br />Dan</div>
